## Review Checklist

### 1. **Code Quality**
- Ensure proper **C# coding conventions** are followed.
- Check for meaningful **variable, method, and class names**.
- Ensure **consistent indentation** and **braces** (preferably curly braces for block statements).
- Check for **code modularity**—ensure functions and classes have a single responsibility.

### 2. **Error Handling**
- Ensure proper **error handling** in place, using `try-catch` blocks where needed.
- Ensure meaningful **error messages** for exceptions.
- Ensure any critical failures are logged appropriately.

### 3. **Security**
- Check for any potential **security vulnerabilities**, like SQL injection or XSS.
- Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed in any logs or error messages.

### 4. **Test Coverage**
- Verify that **unit tests** are present for all new functionality.
- Ensure that the existing tests are not broken by the new code.
- If applicable, check for integration tests and verify they pass.

### 5. **Performance**
- Ensure that no **performance bottlenecks** exist (e.g., avoid unnecessary loops, reduce complexity).
- Review the code for **asynchronous operations** and ensure proper use of `async` and `await`.

### 6. **Documentation**
- Ensure that code comments are provided where necessary.
- Verify that class and method summaries are present, especially for public methods and properties.
- If there are any changes in functionality, ensure that the **README** or documentation is updated accordingly.

### 7. **Code Style & Formatting**
- Use **Consistent Naming** conventions (`PascalCase` for classes, methods, properties, etc., `camelCase` for local variables).
- Ensure **spacing** between methods and classes.
- Check that the code **does not contain commented-out code** or **unused variables**.

### Tools Integration
- Use **Super-Linter** for style checks.
- Use **SonarQube** for code quality and security analysis.

Please review the code against these points and ensure compliance.
